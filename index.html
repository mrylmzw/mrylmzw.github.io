    <p>We have words like </p>

    <ul>
        <li>puppy</li>
        <li>dam</li>
        <li>sire</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 
        Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.
        Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to 
        thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
